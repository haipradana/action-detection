# Action Detection on MERL Shopping Dataset


### MERL Shopping Dataset

The MERL Shopping Dataset contains 106 videos, each of which is a sequence ~2 minutes long. Each video contains several instances of the following **5 actions:**


  1. **Reach To Shelf**      (reach to shelf)

  2. **Retract From Shelf**  (retract hand from shelf)

  3. **Hand In Shelf**       (extended period with hand in the shelf)

  4. **Inspect Product**     (inspect product while holding it in hand)

  5. **Inspect Shelf**       (look at shelf while not touching and not reaching for the shelf)
